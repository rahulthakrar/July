1. Flutter Introduction

Que 1 :
	Explain the benefits of using Flutter over other cross-platform frameworks.
Answer :
	Flutter delivers native-like performance with its own rendering engine, while its single codebase and hot reload accelerate development across platforms.

Que 2 :
	Describe the role of Dart in Flutter. What are its advantages for mobile development?
	
Answer :
	Dart is Flutter's native language, enabling features like hot reload for rapid development and ahead-of-time compilation for fast, native performance.

Que 3 :
	Outline the steps to set up a Flutter development environment.
Answer :
	1. Download Flutter SDK & extract it.
2. Add Flutter to your system path.
3. Run `flutter doctor` to install needed dependencies (Android Studio, Xcode, etc.).
4. Configure an editor (VS Code/Android Studio) with the Flutter & Dart plugins.

Que 4 :
	Describe the basic Flutter app structure, explaining main.dart, the main function, and the
 widget tree.
Answer :
	The `main.dart` file contains the `main()` function, which is the entry point. It runs the `runApp()` function with a root widget (like `MaterialApp`), which builds the entire widget tree.
